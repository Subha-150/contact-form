# contact-form
A clean, responsive contact form utilizing native HTML5 validation, semantic grouping, and a JavaScript-powered success state for a seamless user experience.
Project Overview:
This project is a high-performance contact form designed to leverage native browser capabilities. 
Developed during my first-year internship, it prioritizes accessibility and clean data entry.

Features:
Form Validation: Uses native HTML5 constraints to provide instant feedback without heavy scripts.
Logical Grouping: Employs fieldset and legend tags to categorize inputs for better user navigation.
Accessible Design: Label tags are strictly associated with inputs to ensure compatibility with assistive technologies.
Feedback Loop: A dynamic success screen replaces the form upon valid submission to confirm user action.

File Structure:
index.html: Contains the semantic markup and internal submission logic.
style.css: Manages the layout, responsive behavior, and visual feedback states.

Input Requirements:
Full Name: Required field with a 50-character limit.
Email: Built-in type-checking for valid email syntax.
Phone: Enforced 10-digit numerical pattern.
Message: Multi-line text entry with a 500-character cap.
